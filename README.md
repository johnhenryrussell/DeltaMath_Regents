This algorithm automates the creation of personalized Algebra I assessments by generating k randomized questions of varying difficulty levels for a chosen standard. To achieve this, the algorithm requires a CSV file of questions, which can be provided as a single file or separate files for each standard.

Once the CSV file(s) is loaded into the algorithm, it will efficiently extract the necessary columns and convert the accuracy values into a float between 0 and 1. The result is a comprehensive data frame called "question_data" that holds all the essential information required to generate a custom assessment.

The algorithm then employs a sophisticated data classification technique called Jenks Natural Breaks to categorize the questions into "Easy", "Normal", and "Hard" difficulty levels. This method uses distinct, non-overlapping classes or categories to group numerical data, ensuring that each question is accurately assigned a difficulty level based on its accuracy score within its respective cluster. The algorithm will add a new column to the dataframe called "Difficulty," which indicates the level of difficulty for each question. 

Our next step is enabling the algorithm to differentiate between assessments that are "Easy", "Normal", or "Hard". To achieve this, we'll create a tuple of weights for each question, which will be assigned based on its level of difficulty. For example, an "Easy" question will be assigned the tuple (75, 20, 0), a "Normal" question will be assigned (25, 70, 25), and a "Hard" question will be assigned (0, 10, 75). These tuples will then be organized into three distinct columns, namely "easy_weight," "normal_weight," and "hard_weight," with each column representing the weight that each question carries in the assessment process.
